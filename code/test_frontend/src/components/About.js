          Hi! I am <span style={{ color: '#F46B6F' }}>Sai Navyanth</span>, a
          final year Computer Science student at CityU. This project is a part
          of my Final Year Project, where I work both on a web-app to predict
          the price of a stock depending on the historical prices by using
          machine learning algorithms. I am personally a tech enthusiast and am
          always looking forward to new challenges.

          Having spent majority of my undergraduate degree during the pandemic
          year, I decided to utilize my tech skills in the finance industry!
          Having worked as the Head of Quantitative Research at the CityU
          Research and Investment Club at my University, I decided to take up
          this project on using ML for stock price prediction as my Final Year
          Project.
